Most of your interactions with Yeoman will be through the command line. Run commands in the Terminal app if you’re on Mac, your shell in Linux, or [`cmder`](http://cmder.net/) *(preferably)* / PowerShell / `cmd.exe` if you are on Windows.

## Install prerequisites

Before installing Yeoman, you will need the following:

* Node.js v4 or higher
* npm (which comes bundled with Node)
* git

You can check if you have Node and npm installed by typing:

```sh
node --version && npm --version
```

If you need to upgrade or install Node, the easiest way is to use an installer for your platform. Download the *.msi* for Windows or *.pkg* for Mac from the [NodeJS website](https://nodejs.org/).

The [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package manager is bundled with Node, although you might need to update it. Some Node versions ship with rather old versions of npm. You can update npm using this command:

```sh
npm install --global npm@latest
```

You can check if you have Git installed by typing:

```sh
git --version
```
If you don't have Git, grab the installers from the [git website](https://git-scm.com/).

## Install the Yeoman toolset

Once you’ve got Node installed, install the Yeoman toolset:

```sh
npm install --global yo
```

  <h2>Errors?</h2>

  <p>If you see permission or access errors, such as <code>EPERM</code> or <code>EACCESS</code>, do not use <code>sudo</code> as a work-around. You can consult <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/master/npm-global-without-sudo.md">this guide</a> for a more robust solution.</p>

## Confirm installation

It is a good idea to check that everything is installed as expected by running commonly used Yeoman commands like `yo` with the `--version` flag as follows:

```sh
yo --version
```
