Allo! Allo! In this 25-minutes codelab, you will build a fully functional web application from scratch with the help of [Yeoman](/) and [FountainJS](http://fountainjs.io). The sample app will be written in [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Angular2](https://angular.io/) or [Angular1](https://angularjs.org/).

Don't know any React or Angular? That's okay, we'll walk you through it. However, we do assume that you have some previous JavaScript experience.

## Build this sample app with Yeoman

The sample web app you'll build today will be a implementation of [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/). You will be able to add todos, delete todos, filter todos, and together we'll add a feature to save todos offline.
