## Like what you see? Yeoman can do more.

Yeoman supports scaffolding out a lot more for Angular and other frameworks than what we’ve shown today.

For example, the Fountain Angular generator also supports creating new pipes, directives, services and components for you. A new components can be scaffolded by running `yo fountain-angular2:component componentName`, which will create your component file but also add a new *componentName.spec.js* for your unit test.

  <h2>Find more sub-generators</h2>

  <p>To find out all the sub-generators for installed Yeoman generators, you can use <code>yo --generators</code>:</p>
