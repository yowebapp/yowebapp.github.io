excerpt: The yeoman project unit testing guidelines

This testing guide is based on Mocha BDD interface (`describe` / `it`).


Main principles
--------------------

#### Tests must start with a clean state

This means prefer `beforeEach` to `before`. Re-instantiate objects before running each `it` blocks. Create every file required by a test in a `beforeEach` (or commit them in `fixtures/`). Reset any side effects done on the test environment after each test.

#### Tests must be runnable in isolation

Each test must pass if they're run alone. You can run a single test by using `mocha test.js --grep 'test name'`.

#### Stub most performance heavy operation

When possible, always stub networks or other long operations.

We use [sinon.js](http://sinonjs.org/) for most stubbing needs.

Naming convention
--------------------

`describe` blocks should cover three types of information: Object to be tested, method/property, circumstantial group (basically, "when _this_").

`it` blocks cover assertions. They should use as few lines of code as possible. There should be as many `it` block as there is assertion on a method effect.

Instance methods and properties should be prefixed by a bang sign (`#find()`). Static methods and properties should be prefixed by a dot (`.exclude()`).

```javascript
// Given this object
function Class() {
  this.args = nopt();
};
Class.exclude = function () {};
Class.name = 'Yeoman';
Class.prototype.find = function () {};

// We'd have this test structure
describe('Class', function () {
  describe('.exclude()', function () {});
  describe('.name', function () {});
  describe('#find()', function () {});
  describe('#args', function () {});
});
```

Methods should end using parentheses, but should not include expected parameters (parameters should be covered in documentation comments).

`it` blocks should be declarative.

```javascript
// BAD
it('should find generators');

// GOOD
it('find generators');
```

Assertion
---------------------

Don't add `message` to assertions unless the error thrown makes it unclear what failed.

If you must add a message, then describe the expected outcome and why it failed. For example:

``` javascript
// BAD
assert(Generator.appname, 'Generator has an `appname` property');

// GOOD
assert(Generator.appname, 'Expected Generator to have an `appname` property');
```

Remember that these message are the error message thrown with the failure. Let those be useful in these occasions.

Stylistic preferences
----------------------

#### `.bind()` throwing assertions

When testing that a method throws with invalid parameters, prefer binding the parameters to creating an anonymous function.

```javascript
// BAD
assert.throws(function () {
  class.method('Invalid param');
});

// GOOD
assert.throws(class.method.bind(class, 'Invalid param'));
```
