This project uses single-quotes, two space indentation, multiple var statements and whitespace around arguments. Use a single space after keywords like `function`. Ex:

``` js
function () { ... }
function foo() { ... }
```

Please ensure any pull requests follow this closely. If you notice existing code which doesn't follow these practices, feel free to shout and we will address this.
