First off, Happy Friday!

Today we released updates to six of our official generators. The complete changelogs can be found in our linked release pages lower down.

Sindre also released a new version of his [Gulp plugin generator](https://github.com/sindresorhus/generator-gulp-plugin-boilerplate), Hemanth released an [Atom Editor package generator](https://github.com/hemanth/generator-atom) and Rob updated [grunt-bower-requirejs](https://github.com/yeoman/grunt-bower-requirejs). Simon is almost ready shipping a huge new feature for `yo` ([composability](https://github.com/yeoman/generator/commits/master)), which we hope to talk about in the next few weeks. Leonardo, Eddie and Rob have been working on a completely new mobile-first design for `yeoman.io` which they hope to get out in the next month. Kevin has been helping out all over the place.

Peter has continued his work on [AssetGraph](https://github.com/assetgraph/assetgraph) and for the brave of heart there's an experimental Yeoman [Webapp generator](https://github.com/Munter/generator-webapp-assetgraph) using it that's available to play with.


## Release Highlights

* Our Gulp WebApp generator now supports [wiredep](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp/commit/f594d53a2f558208ab011398a96a9de4b1f853b1) so any dependencies installed with Bower will be automatically wired up to your index for you.
* Our Backbone generator now provides more useful boilerplate scaffolding (thanks to the community, and Revath for maintaining)
* Our Grunt WebApp generator gets a big update with numerous stability fixes. We've also switched to using the official Bootstrap Sass package.

## Community

On the community-front, we've started work on our next monthly digest but until then enjoy this quick video on [building a budgeting webapp](http://tagtree.tv/angular-with-yeoman) with Yo and Angular.

Until next time, have an awesome weekend!
